Fika
=================
The only thing a Swede likes more than having a **fika** (which means, essentially, coffee and cake) is talking about the word fika and how you’ll never find it in English.

<dl>
  <dt>You</dt>
  <dd>So it’s like a coffee break?</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Swede</dt>
  <dd>No, no, it’s a lot more than just coffee. There are cinnamon buns.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>You</dt>
  <dd>Ah, so more like a high tea, perhaps?</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Swede</dt>
  <dd>Tea? Don’t insult me, it’s coffee. And cakes.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>You</dt>
  <dd>So coffee and cakes then...</dd>

<dl>
  <dt>Swede</dt>
  <dd>Well that’s not one word, is it? Shut up and eat your cake.</dd>
